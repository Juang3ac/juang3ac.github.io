            <h3>Dr. Isaac Asimov</h3>
            <p>He was a Russian-born American Jewish author and biochemist, a highly successful and exceptionally prolific writer best known for his works of science fiction and for his many non-fiction books, including several genres: popular science writings, guides to the bible and science, mystery novels, literature commentary (his works on Shakespeare) and history.</p>
            <p>Asimov was by general consensus a master of the science-fiction genre and, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, was considered to be one of the "Big Three" science-fiction writers during his lifetime. His most famous novels are those based in the Foundation Universe including the Robot, Empire, and&nbsp;<a title="Foundation series" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation series</a>.</p>
            <p>Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 9,000 letters and postcards. His works have been published in nine of the ten major categories of the Dewey Decimal System (all except the 100s, Philosophy)</p>

            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>He was born in Petrovichi, Russia, but his family migrated to the USA when he was three years old. He graduated from Columbia University in 1939 and took a Ph.D. in chemistry there in 1948. In between, he spent three years during World War II working at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station. After the war ended, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving for just under nine months before receiving a honorable discharge.</p>
            <p>His physical dexterity was very poor. He never learned how to swim or ride a bicycle, although he did learn to drive a car and found he enjoyed it. He did not learn to operate a car until after he moved to Boston, Massachusetts. In his jokebook&nbsp;<em><a title="Asimov Laughs Again" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Asimov_Laughs_Again">Asimov Laughs Again</a></em>, he describes Boston driving as "anarchy on wheels".</p>
            <p>He started writing for science fiction magazines like&nbsp;<em><span class="new" title="Astounding (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQXN0b3VuZGluZz9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=">Astounding</span></em>. John W. Campbell, then editor of Astounding Science Fiction, was a strong formative influence and eventually became a personal friend. He published in 1950 under&nbsp;<span class="new" title="Doubleday (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvRG91YmxlZGF5P2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">Doubleday</span>&nbsp;his first novel,&nbsp;<em><a title="Pebble in the Sky" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Pebble_in_the_Sky">Pebble in the Sky</a></em>. He wrote a collection of robot stories called&nbsp;<em><a title="I, Robot" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/I,_Robot">I, Robot</a></em>&nbsp;on the genre of&nbsp;<a title="Robot series" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Robot_series">Robot series</a>. He then later wrote his&nbsp;<a title="Foundation series" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation series</a>.</p>
            <p>In 1941, "<a title="Nightfall" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Nightfall">Nightfall</a>" was a famous short story which has been described as one of "the most famous science-fiction stories of all time". Another short tale that has been very famous and probably one of the author's favorites (he said so when asked about it) is "<a title="The Last Question" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Question">The Last Question</a>". It is about the fight against entropy. Every good amount of years a question is performed about stopping entropy. The question is posed to the best computer in each epoch.</p>
            <p>He also write juvenile stories on his&nbsp;<a title="Lucky Starr series" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Lucky_Starr_series">Lucky Starr series</a>.</p>
            <p>From 1985 until his death in 1992, he was president of the American Humanist Association.</p>
            <p>The asteroid 5020 Asimov, the magazine&nbsp;<em><a title="Asimov's Science Fiction" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Asimov%27s_Science_Fiction">Asimov's Science Fiction</a></em>, a Brooklyn, NY elementary school, and two different Isaac Asimov Awards are named in his honor.</p>
            <p>He won a Nebula Award in 1973 for Best Novel for&nbsp;<em><a title="The Gods Themselves" href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gods_Themselves">The Gods Themselves</a></em>. He also won six Hugo Awards for several novels.</p>
            <p>He died in 1992. His wife has published some tales about Norby, a fictional robot created by him.</p>

            <h3>Authors inspired by him</span></h3>
            <p>Besides movies, his Foundation and Robot stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as Roger MacBride Allen, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford and David Brin. These appear to have been done with the blessing, and often at the request of, Asimov's widow Janet Asimov.</p>
