            <p><img src="images/article2.jpg"></p>
            <p class="no_name">A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Isaac Asimov wrote one of the most beloved science-fiction sagas of all time. Foundation, a sprawling history of the far future, has now been adapted for the bingewatch generation. But the source material Apple is really drawing on with this $45 million epic is far more recent than the Asimov novels, the first of which was published in 1951.</p>
            <p class="no_name"><strong>Foundation</strong>&nbsp;(Apple TV+, streaming from today) is Game of Thrones in space. It&rsquo;s even filmed in Ireland, with Limerick&rsquo;s Troy Studios taking the place of Game of Thrones&rsquo; Belfast HQ. And, in Jared Harris, it stars the scion of one of the greatest sons of the Treaty City, Richard Harris.</p>
            <p class="no_name">Foundation is ponderous, gorgeously wrought and has very little to do with Asimov. And with so much CGI you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to tell it was made in Ireland &ndash; although there is a starring role for the iconic Long Room library at Trinity College Dublin, as a stand-in for a reading room in the imperial capital of Trantor.</p>
            <blockquote class="inline__content inline__content--pullquote">Lee Pace is chewing all&nbsp;the scenery in Foundation. And although that puts daylight between the series and Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s thoughtful novels, it also brings an essential spark</blockquote>
            <p class="no_name">Trantor is the centre of life, the universe and everything. It&rsquo;s a city the size of a planet, ruled over by Emperor Cleon, who has audaciously divided himself into three personalities.</p>
            <p class="no_name">These are Brother Dawn, a child, Brother Day, a middle-aged man, and Brother Dusk, a greybeard. And, as the story begins, Emperors One, Two and Three sense trouble ahead. A pesky mathematician has produced a formula that he claims proves the empire is about to enter a long decline.</p>
            <p class="no_name">The expert, Hari Seldon, is a familiar Jared Harris character: a harried Everyman with a meek demeanour under which lurk volcanic tide pools. He has acquired a new apprentice, Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell), although his timing could have been better, as both are arrested by the emperor on her first day on the job.</p>
            <p class="no_name">The best and worst thing about Foundation is Lee Pace as Cleon in his Brother Day guise of robust early middle-age. Pace&rsquo;s highest-profile role was as Ronan the Accuser in Guardians of the Galaxy: a blue-faced alien who dreamed of conquering the galaxy and also knew all the words to Life Is a Rollercoaster.</p>
            <p class="no_name">He&rsquo;s chewing&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>the scenery in Foundation. And although that puts daylight between the series and Asimov&rsquo;s thoughtful novels, it also brings an essential spark. Cleon burns up the screen like a grown-up Prince Joffrey with the safety catch removed &ndash; and thank goodness for that. Otherwise Foundation is a big, empty space epic that seeks to cash in on the Asimov legacy but is ultimately built on sand.</p>
