            <h1>Foundation season 2: cast, plot and everything we know so far </h1>
            <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/foundation-season-2-cast-plot-and-everything-we-know-so-far" target="blank"><h5>By techradar</h5></a>
            <p><img src="images/article1.jpg"></p>
            <p>Foundation season 2 is in the works for Apple TV Plus. The streamer&rsquo;s flagship sci-fi series was renewed for another outing in October 2021 &ndash; which isn&rsquo;t a huge surprise, given how much money, time and effort has been poured into the show thus far.</p>
            <p>Still, it&rsquo;s pleasing to read that Foundation season 2 is in development. In our view, the show&nbsp;<a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/foundation-episode-1-recap-an-ambitious-but-clunky-start-to-apples-new-flagship-show" data-component-tracked="1"><u>initially suffered&nbsp;</u></a>from&nbsp;<a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/foundation-episode-2-recap-a-star-wars-style-story-with-game-of-thrones-shocks" data-component-tracked="1"><u>teething issues</u></a>. But its first season grew stronger as it progressed, culminating in an&nbsp;<a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/foundation-episode-10-recap-clone-wars-and-family-reunions" data-component-tracked="1"><u>absorbing season finale</u></a>&nbsp;that, well, lays the foundations for even more enthralling episodes to come.</p>
            <aside class="hawk-nest hawk-processed" data-render-type="fte" data-skip="dealsy" data-widget-type="seasonal" data-widget-id="1384291674147171600" data-result="missing"></aside>
            <p>So what do we know about Foundation&rsquo;s second season? Not a lot. There&rsquo;s no confirmed release date yet, nor does it seem like any major developments have taken place.</p>
            <p>Based on how season 1 ended, which characters were still alive after its finale, and Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s beloved novels, though, we can build a picture of what Foundation season 2&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;contain. Below, we&rsquo;ve compiled everything we know about Foundation&rsquo;s second season, including potential plot points, which actors are expected to return, the series&rsquo; future, and more.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s unclear when Foundation season 2 will be released. As we mentioned, there&rsquo;s no in-depth information on where the show&rsquo;s creative team is with its development, or when the cast and crew will begin filming.</p>
            <p>What we&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;know is that showrunner David S. Goyer is ready to get to work as soon as possible. Speaking to&nbsp;<a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://collider.com/foundation-tv-series-david-s-goyer-sandman-hellraiser-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-url="https://collider.com/foundation-tv-series-david-s-goyer-sandman-hellraiser-interview/" data-component-tracked="1"><u>Collider</u></a>, Goyer revealed that season 2&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;enter production in 2022 if everyone was readily available, but declined to elaborate further on how much of season 2 had been written so far.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, one of Foundation&rsquo;s main cast members was more forthcoming about where season 2 is on the production line. Leah Harvey, who plays Salvor Hardin, told&nbsp;<a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://tvline.com/2021/11/19/foundation-recap-season-1-finale-leah-harvey-preview-season-2/" data-url="https://tvline.com/2021/11/19/foundation-recap-season-1-finale-leah-harvey-preview-season-2/" data-component-tracked="1"><u>TVLine</u></a>&nbsp;that &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already started work on season 2,&rdquo; so&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;aspects of development have started to move into gear.</p>
            <p>Providing principal photography begins on Foundation season 2 this year, it wouldn&rsquo;t be released until 2023 at the earliest. Foundation is a massive undertaking for everyone involved, so there&rsquo;s plenty of storyboarding and script writing to conduct, filming to complete&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;post-production work to be carried out before it&rsquo;s ready to be released. Our opinion? Don&rsquo;t expect its arrival before mid to late 2023.</p>
            <p>While fans of Asimov&rsquo;s novels may think they know where season 2&rsquo;s story will go, the source material can&rsquo;t be relied upon to divulge any major story beats. Why? Because, although the creators used the books as a basis for Foundation&rsquo;s TV adaptation, the show had largely diverged from Asimov&rsquo;s novels by its season 1 finale.</p>
            <p>Still, there are plenty of unresolved plot threads and storylines that need to be picked up and addressed in Foundation season 2. And, based on comments made by the cast and crew, we have a few pointers about where certain storylines and character arcs may go.</p>
            <p>For his part, Goyer explained that answers to some of season 1&rsquo;s open-ended plot points will be resolved in future seasons, telling&nbsp;<a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://collider.com/foundation-tv-series-david-s-goyer-sandman-hellraiser-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-url="https://collider.com/foundation-tv-series-david-s-goyer-sandman-hellraiser-interview/" data-component-tracked="1"><u>Collider</u></a>: &ldquo;If there's a question that we haven't answered, there's a reason why we haven't answered it. It's not because we forgot about it. It's &lsquo;watch this space&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Goyer was, though, happy to tease how certain season 1 events may impact its successor.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest moments in the season 1 finale was the revelation that Brothers Dawn, Day and Dusk &ndash; portrayed by Cassian Bilton, Lee Pace and Terrence Mann &ndash; are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;identical clones of Cleon I. After Eto Demerzel (Laura Birn) killed Dawn&rsquo;s current incarnation due to genetic differences that supposedly made him an impure clone, it&rsquo;s revealed that&nbsp;<em>all</em> of Cleon&rsquo;s clones are genetically unique. An anti-Empire resistance group, that included Dawn&rsquo;s ex-lover Azura, had tampered with the DNA of Cleon I&rsquo;s host body decades earlier, ensuring that none of the Empire&rsquo;s current rulers are identical clones of Cleon I.</p>
